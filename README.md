# Labguru-Task
This is a coding assignment.
It has 2 parts - front test and ruby test.

# Ruby Test:
**Task 1**:
- If I do not provide any input to the system, the input would be nil (null)
  resulting in nothing getting printed to the screen.
  
- When dealing with inputs / outputs, a programmer should think about the input's / output's:
  type, format, expected value and validation.

**Task 3**:
- I assume that the garden has seperated zones and that each irrigation system is set in a specific zone.
  Also, I assume that the system has an API that allows the user to control the system.
- I would design it in a way that allows me to control each irrigation system's uptime with an alarm system (on hh:mm:ss
  start working for hh:mm:ss), and control the amount of water each system use while taking each plant type and any fertilizers used in account.
- I would need an object of a:
  - Garden
  - Irrigation System
  - Sprinkler
  - Dripper
  - Plant
  - Fertilizer
  - Communication (For the API)
